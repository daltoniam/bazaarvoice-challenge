# bazaarvoice-challenge
Bazaarvoice programming exercise

### Notes:

No external dependencies in the project. The only things include are my JSON parsing library and collectionViewManger classes, but they are both just a single file so I copied them in into the project.

I think the rest of the project's code comments and logic should be adequate, but please let me know if there are any questions!
